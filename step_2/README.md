### STEP 2 : Collecting tissue specific data and establishing a control list

**Period**: Week 5 and 16 (03/10/2022 to 29/12/2022)

**Goal**: Collecting tissue specific data to run the model and establishing a positive and negative control list


**1. Collecting tissue**

In order to collect the relevant tissue for OA, we established inclusion and exclusion criteria on the kind of tissue and data type we are looking for to run the model.
We used PubMed, the Musculoskeletal Knowledge portal, Encode, and Roadmap to browse through the datasets. 

You can find the [criteria](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_2/criteria.md) and the [collecting strategy and results](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_2/collection%20strategy.md) here.

For more detailed information, check this [file](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_2/TSV/Strategy.txt) and this [one](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_2/TSV/Overview%20data.txt).

**2. Annotation**

Annotation files are already available on the GitHub page of the ABC model. For our analysis, we need to establish a list of GWAS SNPs linked to OA for the fine-mapping step. 
You can find more information [here](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_2/annotations.md).

**3. Control list** 

Why? To be sure the model is running correctly, we established a (+) list of relevant SNPs that should score high according to previous papers.  
We are also including a (-) list of genes that shouldn't appear in our results.

You can find the [Control list](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_2/control%20list.md) here.
