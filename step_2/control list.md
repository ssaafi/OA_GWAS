**1. Criteria for the (+) control list**

We conducted literature research and looked for SNPs strongly associated with OA. 
The list is short as, for now, only 100 SNPs are confirmed to be associated with OA.

**Results (+) control**

To start establishing our list, we used 12 articles: 

    - doi: 10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-211214
    - doi: 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217834
    - doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2021.07.038
    - doi: 10.1186/s13075-022-02882-y
    - doi: 10.1002/art.40849
    - doi: 10.1002/art.41473
    - doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddn082
    - doi: 10.1016/j.joca.2012.02.207
    - doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006260
    - doi: 10.1093/genetics/iyac141
    - doi: 10.1038/ng.3911
    - doi: 10.1016/j.joca.2021.03.002

We ended up with 16 potential candidates. We collected information on position/pathway/OA phenotype for each relevant SNPs using NCBI and UniProt websites, among others.

To filter the most relevant candidates, we established some criteria:
    1. the link between the variant and the gene should be proved by at least one of the following
        a. 3D structure assays
        b. eQTLs experiments
        c. tissue specificity
    2. a strong association of the variant with OA 

Next, we looked for additional articles that confirmed the functional link between SNP/gene & SNP/OA.

The final positive control list includes:

1. GDF5 - rs143383
2. MGP - rs1800801
3. ALDH1A2 - rs3204689
4. COLGALT2 - rs11583641
5. TGFB1 - rs75621460 

**2. Criteria for (-) control list**

We are looking for SNPs unrelated to OA, which, therefore, shouldn't appear in the results.
This includes: PDL3 (gene associated with Alzheimer)
