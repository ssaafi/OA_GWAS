**1. Inclusion criteria**

We are looking for tissues (both healthy and OA) related to the joint:

    - Muscle: myo-blasts/-cytes
    - Synovium: synoviocytes 
    - Cartilage: chondrocytes
    - Bone: osteoblasts and osteoclasts
    - Stem cell (OA is linked to growth development)

For 5 data types

    - ATAC-seq (bam file)
    - DMase-Seq (bam file)
    - Hi-C data
    - Chip- Seq (bam file): histones markers H3K27ac (mark of active enhancer and promoter), H3K4me1 (mark for active promoter), H3K4me3 (mark for enhancer) and H3K27me3 (mark for high OA expression)
    - gene expression data


**2. Exclusion criteria**

Most reasons articles/data sets were disregarded because they included:
    
    - animal samples
    - transfected material 
    - other diseases such as rheumatic arthritis 
    - blood samples
    - fibroblasts samples
    - adipocytes 
    - heart muscles samples
    - smooth muscle samples
    - health status of the patient is unknown
