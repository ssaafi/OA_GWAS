### STEP 4 : Running the model

**Period**: Week 13/03 - June 2023

**Goal**: Succesfully running the model for cartilage samples


**1. Strategy to run the model**

We are planning to run the data by tissue and divide healthy and OA samples.
We are also looking into the literature on how other groups applied the model.

More information will follow [here](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_3/strategy.md).

**2. Protocol 1**

Step by step procedure to implement the model with healthy cartilage data.
You can find the code and the GEO datasets we are using [here](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/blob/main/step_4/Protocol_1.md).
