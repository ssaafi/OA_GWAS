# Master's Thesis Project

## Project in a nutshell

**Osteoarthritis (OA)** is a multifactorial and disabling disease characterized by the degeneration of protective cartilage affecting all synovial joints. OA is one of the fastest-growing diseases worldwide and a major socio-economic burden. This research project aimed to study the effect of osteoarthritis variants on genes located further upstream or downstream of the variant in cartilage and bone tissues. To investigate the regulation at the 3D chromatin configuration level, a new approach for OA was implemented using a well-established prediction tool linking enhancers to genes, the Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model. 

The ABC model, along with publicly available chromatin, histone, and expression data, was applied to develop a genome-wide chondrocyte enhancer-gene map. Using the chondrocyte and the previously generated osteoblast maps, our findings confirmed the link between established OA effector genes and highlighted potential new genes of interest. The model’s predictions showed that many OA SNPs were found in enhancer regions targeting multiple genes, demonstrating the underlying reasons for some SNPs’ large biological effects in different pathways. Specifically, rs75621460 (TGFB1) was present in enhancer regions of the two analyzed tissues and displayed a broad set of gene targets. This SNP can be a potential candidate for the development of curative treatments. Additionally, high association scores were recorded in SNPs located within promoter regions rendering them regions of interest in further studies. Overall, the study supported evidence that the ABC model can be a valuable technique for understanding the functional genetic landscape of OA effectively and automatically.

## Workflow

**[Step 1](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/tree/main/step_1)**: Running the model using the example data on our server (2 weeks)

**[Step 2](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/tree/main/step_2)**: Collecting tissue-specific data and establishing a control list (11 weeks)

**[Step 3](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/tree/main/step_3)**: Preparing the data (14 weeks)

**[Step 4](https://github.com/ssaafi/OA_GWAS/tree/main/step_4)**: Running the model (ongoing)
