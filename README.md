# Master's Thesis Project

## Project in a nutshell

**Osteoarthrisis (OA)** is a multifactorial disease characterized by the degeneration of protective cartilage affecting the joints of the knee, hands, spine, and hips. It is one of the fastest growing diseases worldwide and a major socio-economic burden. The hallmark clinical symptom is pain, rendering OA highly disabling for the patients. Still, the exact pathophysiology remains unclear. According to previous studies, genetic factors are hypothesized to be involved in the onset of OA. Therefore, unravelling the genetic etiology could lead to better understanding of the disease and curative treatments which are currently lacking.

Hence, the focus of this project is to identify (novel) genes linked to OA by using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to characterize associated variants in order to investigate novel drug target for treatment.

During the study, we will assess respectively the expression and the regulation of a set of OA effector genes from bone and cartilage samples. Therefore, we will combine large bioinformatics databases from OA patients material (epigenomics, transcriptomics, 3D chromatin configuration, transcription factor binding sites) from different projects. In addition to the reference algorithms used to work with large public data, we will implement a new approach using a **prediction model (ABC model)** to study the regulation at the 3D chromatin configuration level. Finally, a drug repurposing software will match the newly found gene targets to existing drugs.

To our knowledge, it will be the first study to integrate the 3D chromatin structure to obtain a better prediction of the target gene and contribute to unravelling the genetic complexity of OA.

## Workflow

**[Step 1](https://github.com/ssaafi/internship22-23/tree/main/step_1)**: Running the model using the example data on our server (2 weeks)

**[Step 2](https://github.com/ssaafi/internship22-23/tree/main/step_2)**: Collecting tissue specific data and establishing a control list (11 weeks)

**[Step 3](https://github.com/ssaafi/internship22-23/tree/main/step_3)**: Preparing the data (14 weeks)

**[Step 4](https://github.com/ssaafi/internship22-23/tree/main/step_4)**: Running the model (ongoing)
