### STEP 3 : Preparing the data

**Period**: Week 17 - finished in March 23

**Goal**: Prepare and convert data in the correct format to run the model

The raw data available in GEO for all datasets are in FastQ. To run the model we need bam files for ATAC-Seq, Dnase-Seq, and Chip-Seq data.
So we need to clean, do the QC, map, sort, and index the raw data.
More work but the advantage is that all samples will be standardized. 

**1. QC**



**2. ATAC-DNase-Chip**



**3. RNA**




**4. HiC**
